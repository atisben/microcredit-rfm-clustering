# Data analysis case study
## Objective
The objective of this assignment is to use the transactional data available to define a
risk segmentation of all customers. The segmentation should include 4 risk classes -
A, B, C, and D - where A represents the least risky customers and D represents the
most risky customers.
To complete this assignment, you will need to:
1. Analyze the transactional data provided to you and identify any patterns or
trends that may indicate a customer's risk level.
2. Use appropriate statistical techniques to segment the customers into the 4 risk
classes.
3. Prepare a short slide deck (15 slides max) to present the chosen approach,
main results and any recommendations to the client. The slide deck should be
designed to convince a potential prospect and should include visual aids such
as charts, graphs, and tables.

## Assumptions

credit scoring models have been extensively investigated and developed for the credit approval assessment of new applicants. Traditionally, some statistical algorithms, such as linear discriminate analysis (LDA) (Altman, 1968) and logistic regression (LR) (Wiginton, 1980) were used to tackle this problem. These statistical methods are widely used due to their simple interpretability and easy implementation

A problem for credit scoring models which needs to be emphasized is the unavailability of real-world credit data, since the customers’ credit data is confidential in most of the financial institutions and the researchers could not get access to these data

- Customer loyalty
- Returns must compensate for risk : measure customer profitability
- estimate the relationship lifetime. This is the period, in months or years, that the relationship with a customer is expected to last
- purchasing volatility:  this volatility can be measured through analysis of previous purchasebehaviour The wider the dispersio (standard deviation) of the forecasts, the greater the risk
risk free x 

A widely used approach to portfolio
management is the capital asset pricing
model (CAPM) which was developed
from work in the 1960s and 1970s by
Sharpe, Lintner and Black to look at risk
and returns on common stocks.12 When
evaluating shares, risk and return are
understood to be positively correlated.
High-risk (high-volatility) investments are
associated with higher returns, which
rational investors require to compensate
them for taking on higher risk. CAPM
has long been associated with the
estimation of risk.1

customer portfolio may more
conveniently be viewed as consisting of a
number of segments which differ from
one another not only by
sociodemographic and attitudinal
characteristics and customer needs, but
also by profitability and ris [1]

# Methodology
 k-means (Kodinariya & Makwana, 2013), hierarchical clustering (Ruppert, 2004), and DBSCAN (Ester, Kriegel, Sander, & Xu, 1996), Kohonen's self-organizing maps (SOM) (Yan, Nie, Wang, & Wang, 2013) and isolation forest (Liu, Ting, & Zhou, 2008).


## Future work
Use hybrid regression and clustering methods
